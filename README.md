# xdrone-Fast-RTPS
A ROS2 node that interfaces to PX4 using Fast RTPS and published enough to get he navigation stack running.
This thing runs in the Gazebo simulator, but I have not bable to test it against a flight controller yet.  I could not get the RTPS/ROS2 PX4-FastRTPS Bridge installed on the Raspberry Pi yet.
